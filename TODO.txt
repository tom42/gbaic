* Time to raise the warning level:
  * MSVC: /W3+treat warnings as errors. If possible, use /W4
  * gcc/clang: -Wall -Werror + what? -Wextra? -Wpedantic?
  * DO NOT modify settings for argp
  * We then need to fix our unit test, because broken it is.
* Set up argument parsing:
  * For starters we need one input file
  * An optional output file (-o)
    * If the output file is not given, default to input file with the extension replaced by .gba
  * This might be a good point to start setting up tests
* Set up top level CMakeLists.txt
  * Go through example CMakeLists.txt and add stuff as needed
    * What about global compiler options? If we set them in the top level file, does argp-standalone inherit them???
      * Just have to do this after going into the subdirectory. Or one level deeper
  * Set up testing
    * Here we must make sure that argp tests are not enabled
