* Set up top level CMakeLists.txt
  * Probe for argp-standalone
  * Build gbaic main.cpp, use native or own argp-standalone
  * Go through example CMakeLists.txt and add stuff as needed
    * What about global compiler options? If we set them in the top level file, does argp-standalone inherit them???
  * Set up testing
    * Here we must make sure that argp tests are not enabled
* Set up gbaic CMakeLists.txt and main.cpp
  * Set up source groups
  * Use either native or own argp
