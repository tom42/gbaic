* Set up argument parsing:
  * Add copyright notice to help screen?
  * Add website/github page to help screen?
* gbaic --help: Add copyright messages? (myself, shrinkler author(s))
* Consider adding some 'run gbaic --help' blurb to messages printed when command line parsing fails.
  * For our own error messages we can add it directly to the exception we throw
  * ccxopts parsing exceptions we can rethrow
  * Other exceptions we leave alone
* Design input file loading
  * Binary files, with an assumed load address of IWRAM (do we allow overriding this?)
  * Elf files, which we convert to raw binary and whose load address we determine from the entry point
