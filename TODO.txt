* OK we can detect Boost:
  * Now set up a unit test suite
    * Do we call that subdirectory "test" or "unittests"? Well, who gives.
    * Do we use the library version or the header only version of boost test?
      * Leaning towards header only, because we then don't need a ton of boost libraries for all sorts of targets we're testing for
* Set up argument parsing:
  * For starters we need one input file
  * An optional output file (-o)
    * If the output file is not given, default to input file with the extension replaced by .gba
  * This might be a good point to start setting up tests
* Set up top level CMakeLists.txt
  * Go through example CMakeLists.txt and add stuff as needed
    * What about global compiler options? If we set them in the top level file, does argp-standalone inherit them???
      * Just have to do this after going into the subdirectory. Or one level deeper
  * Set up testing
    * Here we must make sure that argp tests are not enabled
