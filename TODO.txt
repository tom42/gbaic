* Somehow hide standard output of the parser in the unit test suite. Is there something like a null stream?
* options class: when the input file is set but the output file is not yet set,
  calculate the output file name by replacing the input filename's extension (if any) with .gba
  * Test: file without extension, e.g. "input"
  * Test: file with extension, e.g. "test.elf"
* Set up argument parsing:
  * For starters we need one input file
  * An optional output file (-o)
    * If the output file is not given, default to input file with the extension replaced by .gba
  * This might be a good point to start setting up tests
  * Add copyright notice to help screen?
  * Add website/github page to help screen?
* gbaic --help: Add copyright messages? (myself, shrinkler author(s))
